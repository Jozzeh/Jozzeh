### Hi there ğŸ‘‹. 

I am **_Jos De Berdt_**.  
A problem-solver that spend several years working in webdevelopment agencies making websites and e-commerce shops. A few years ago, I shifted to big web-applications. I love it. There is nothing greater than going from an idea to a good product and I feel lucky to be a part in that process.  
  
ğŸ’¬ As a technical architect, I look at the bigger picture and create a fast, solid development environment.  
ğŸ’¬ As a team lead / team player, I'm invested in creating an open culture where every team member is on board and gets work done.  
ğŸ’¬ As a developer, I want to create the best product for the end-user.
